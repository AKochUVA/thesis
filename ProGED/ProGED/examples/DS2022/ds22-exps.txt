I cannot tell for sure, but as far as I can see from old lorenz.py file,
I used the following times and initial values:

T = np.linspace(0.48, 0.85, 1000)  # Times currently run at.
with following initial values:
y0 = [0.1, 0.4, 0.5]

in 2 different scenarios:
# non-chaotic configuration:
    sigma = 1.3  # 1 # 0
    rho = -15  # 1 # 0
    beta = 3.4  # 1 # 0
# Chaotic configuration:
    sigma = 10  # 1 # k0
    rho = 28  # 1 # 0
    beta = 8/3  # 1 # 0


But in my old file I also have notes with recommend values from wiki:

T = np.linspace(0, 40, 4000)  # Chaotic Lorenz times noted on Wiki.
y0 = [1, 1, 1]  # Chaotic Lorenz initial values noted on Wiki.

# # Lorenz's sode (for reference):
# dx/dt = \sigma * (y-x)
# dy/dt = x*(\rho-z) - y
# dz/dt = x*y - \beta*z
