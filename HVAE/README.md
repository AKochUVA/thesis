EDHiE, a mad scientist frantically searching for the right mathematical expression:

**We are currently refactoring and improving some code and its performance, so some parts of the code might be broken.**

An overview of the approach (shown on the symbolic regression example) can be seen below.
![algorithm overview](https://github.com/smeznar/HVAE/blob/master/images/overview.png)

## Quickstart instructions
1. Install HVAE/EDHiE
2. Set up your config file (use _configs/test_config.json_ as a template)
3. Create a set of expressions with the _expression_set_generation.py_ script and a custom grammar suitable for your problem
4. Train a HVAE model with the _train.py_ script
5. Run the _symbolic_regression.py_ script

## Installing HVAE/EDHiE
To install and test HVAE, do the following:
1. Install rust (instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
2. Create a new (conda) environment
3. Install dependencies with the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. (Optional - expression set generation) `pip install git+https://github.com/brencej/ProGED`

## Using HVAE and EDHiE
This repository implements both HVAE and EDHiE (HVAE + evolutionary algorithm). HVAE is an autoencoder that needs to be trained before we are able to use it as either a generator or for equation discovery/symbolic regression.
Sections **Expression set generation** and **Model training** show the steps needed to train a model.

## Expression set generation
We use a set of expressions stored in a json file as training data for our model. Such a file can be obtained in two ways:
  1. Use an existing set of expressions and convert it to a suitable file
  2. Create a new set of expressions using the _expression_set_generation.py_ script.

1.) An existing set of expressions can be converted to a suitable file with the function "expression_set_to_json" from the _hvae_utils.py_.
This function takes as input a list of expressions (represented as a list of symbols). An example script (_expression_set_to_json.py_) for this use-case with more detailed instructions can be found in the _examples_ folder.

2.) If you currently don't have a set of expressions with which you would like to train the model, you can either find some in the _data/expression_sets/_ directory or generate a new set of expressions using the _expression_set_generation.py_ script (recommended).
A universal probabilistic grammar for creating expressions is given, but it is recommended that you define a grammar that suits your problem. An example of such a grammar (_grammar.txt_) with some further instructions can be found in the _examples_ directory.

## Model training
A HVAE model can be train using the _train.py_ script. All parameters for training are contained in the config file. 
All these parameters are explained in the example config file _configs/test_config.json_.

## Evaluation scenarios
Our motivation for this approach is symbolic regression (equation discovery), a machine learning task where you try to find a closed-form solution that fits the given data.
In case of symbolic regression, HVAE is used to generate expression. To explore the latent space produced by HVAE efficiently, 
our variational autoencoder needs to possess the following characteristics:
- Produce syntactically valid expressions; HVAE produces only syntactically valid expressions by design,
- Reconstruct (unseen) expressions well; otherwise we cannot expect that the latent space will have structure and the expressions
produced by the generator are always random (we do not profit from methods for optimization in continuous space)
- Points close in the latent space need to produce (for now syntactically) similar expressions; This makes exploration of 
the latent space using optimization possible.

In this section we show how to evaluate these characteristics and how to run symbolic regression experiments using HVAE.

**Disclaimer:** Since submission of the manuscript "Efficient generator of mathematical expressions for symbolic regression",
we changed some parts of the approach (mostly BatchedNode, regularization, and symbolic regression script) which may impact
performance.

## Reconstruction Accuracy
The code for evaluating reconstruction accuracy can be found in *src/reconstruction_accuracy.py* script. Similar to 
model training, parameters for this script can be found in the config file.

Table below shows the percentage of syntactically correct expressions and the reconstruction accuracy (evaluated as the edit
distance between the original and the predicted expression in the postfix notation).

Additionally, we show the efficiency of HVAE with regard to the number of training examples needed and the dimension of latent space below.

# Linear interpolation
We use linear interpolation to show that points close in the latent space produce similar expressions. We encode expressions 
into the latent space with the encoder, generating vectors $z_A$ and $z_B$. Then we create a sequence of points $z_\alpha$
with the formula: $z_\alpha = (1-\alpha)\cdot z_A + \alpha\cdot z_B$, where $\alpha = i/n, i\in 0, ..., n$ and $n$ the 
number of points we want to create. 

To try it out use the _linear_interpolation.py_ script. Most parameters for linear interpolation can be found in the 
config file; script contains the two expressions we want to interpolate between and the number of steps in the interpolation.

Some results of linear interpolation are shown in the table below:

## Symbolic regression
For evaluation of EDHiE (Equation Discovery with Hierarchical variational autoEncoders = HVAE + evolutionary algorithm)
on the symbolic regression task, you can use the script _symbolic_regression.py_. Most parameters for symbolic regression
can be found (and are explained) in the config file.

Results of symbolic regression are saved into a file that contains the best expression and its error on both the train and
the test set, as well as the number of evaluated and generated expressions and top n candidates.

Some results of symbolic regression on the Nguyen symbolic regression benchmark can be found in the table below.
